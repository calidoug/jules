	<p>
		Jules is able to learn from your feedback.  Calls, texts, and tweets give you the oppurtunity to help her learn by leaving feedback.  This feedback is easy to give and self-explanatory on phone calls and texts.  With Twitter, you can tweet back to Jules #feedback followed by a 0 for a poor response and a 1 for a good response.  This helps Jules answer questions better in the future.
